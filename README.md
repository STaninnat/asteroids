# ðŸš€Asteroids Game

This project is a clone of the classic Asteroids game built using Pygame and object-oriented programming concepts. The objective of this project is to help understand how to use Pygame to create a game loop, handle user input, and manage game state.

## Features

- **Game Loop:** A continuous loop that updates game objects and renders them to the screen.
- **User Input Handling:** Controls for moving the spaceship, shooting, and managing game interactions.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Classes and objects to represent the spaceship, asteroids, bullets, and more.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.x:** The programming language used for this project.
- **Pygame:** A library for creating video games in Python.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. run ```python main.py``` in terminal.

## Usage
- W A S D Keys: Move the spaceship.
- Space Bar: Shoot bullets.
